Hello World!,
Hello Humans!, and
Hello peasants!

This is based out of a tutorial found here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

"Somewhere on a toilet wall I read the words: 'You form a line to formalize the former lies' and I finnaly saw the truth. Something so profound and now it's sitting there surrounded by the garbage and the stains; another victim of the refuse. Oh I've been saying this for years but you don't comprehend it. I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it. Androgony and insults... Your choice! Don't wanna be difficult. You wanna win the war? Know what you're fighting for!"
